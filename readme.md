# Text Summarization Using Seq2Seq

This repository contains the implementation of a text summarization project using Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models. The project demonstrates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to summarize long-form text into concise, meaningful summaries.

## Overview
Text summarization is a critical task in NLP, with applications ranging from news summarization to legal document abstraction. This project leverages Seq2Seq models, enhanced by attention mechanisms, to generate high-quality summaries from input text.

The implementation follows these major steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - The dataset consists of articles and their corresponding highlights (summaries) in CSV format.
   - Basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data distribution.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning, tokenization, and vocabulary creation.
   - Sequence padding and truncation for uniform input lengths.
   - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **Model Design**
   - Implementation of a Seq2Seq model with an encoder-decoder architecture.
   - Use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for capturing sequential dependencies.
   - Attention mechanism for improved focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.

4. **Training and Optimization**
   - Use of techniques like teacher forcing for efficient training.
   - Model checkpointing and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

5. **Evaluation and Metrics**
   - Use of ROUGE and BLEU scores to evaluate the quality of generated summaries.
   - Comparison of model performance with baseline methods.

## Prerequisites
The project is implemented in Python and relies on the following libraries:

- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk

Ensure that you have these libraries installed before running the notebook.

## Project Flow
1. **Load Data**: Import the dataset and perform EDA.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Clean and tokenize text, and prepare inputs for the model.
3. **Build the Model**:
   - Encoder processes the input sequence and captures its context.
   - Decoder generates the summary based on the encoderâ€™s output and attention weights.
4. **Train the Model**: Train on the training set with validation monitoring.
5. **Evaluate the Model**: Use the test set to compute ROUGE and BLEU scores.
6. **Generate Summaries**: Apply the model to new articles and generate summaries.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/text-summarization
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook text_summarization.ipynb
   ```

## Results
- The model achieves competitive ROUGE and BLEU scores on the test dataset.
- Generated summaries are coherent and contextually relevant.

## Future Work
- Extend the model to handle multi-document summarization.
- Experiment with Transformer-based architectures like BERT and GPT.
- Optimize for low-resource environments using model quantization.
